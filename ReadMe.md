## About this code  
This code was written to calculate local contour deviation according to the reference paper. 
Reference: Jenkins, Alexander, et al. "Novel methodology to assess the effect of contouring variation on treatment outcome." Medical Physics (2021).  

### The different thing b/w the reference paper  
The reference code is not consider of the sign of the calcualted distance (only return absolute distance)
But, in this code, the sign of the calculated distance is considered.
